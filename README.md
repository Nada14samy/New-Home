# Petopia

## Project Idea
New Home is a pet adoption website aimed at simplifying the process of finding pets available for adoption and providing detailed information about each pet. The website is designed for pet lovers looking to adopt a pet easily, and it supports both Arabic and English languages to offer a comfortable user experience.

## Website Components
### 1. Home Page
The Home page provides an introduction to the website and its goals, explaining how to use the site to search for pets available for adoption. The page includes information such as:

- The purpose of the website.
- How it works.
- Ways to get started with the adoption process.

### 2. Find a Pet Page
On the Find a Pet page, various categories of pets (such as cats, dogs, birds, etc.) are displayed. This page contains:

- Pet Categories: Main categories of pets are displayed in cards.
- Show More Button: By clicking this button for each category, all available pets in that section will be displayed.
- Pet Details: When clicking on any specific pet card, the user is directed to a page with detailed information about the pet, including:
  - Name.
  - Age.
  - Type.
  - Health details.
  - Availability date.

### 3. Signup Page
The Signup page allows new users to create an account by entering their personal details such as:

- Name
- Email
- Password
After entering the correct information, the user is redirected to the Verify Email page, where a verification code is sent to the entered email. The user must:

- Enter the verification code on the Verify Email page to activate the account.
- Once the code is correctly entered, the account creation process is completed.

### 4. Login Page
The Login page is for existing users to sign in to their accounts using:

- Email
- Password
Through this page, users can access their accounts and start using the site's full features.

### 5. Multilingual Feature

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
